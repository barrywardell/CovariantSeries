CovariantSeries - Version 1.0
===============================================================================
Copyright 2009-2011 Barry Wardell

The CovariantSeries package and the associated AbstractMatrix package provide
symbolic Mathematica code for calculating covariant series expansions of
fundamental bi-tensors including the world-function, the van Vleck determinant,
the bi-vector of parallel transport, the bi-scalar V(x,x') appearing in the
Hadamard form of the scalar Green function and the DeWitt coefficients.

Getting the package
-------------------
The latest version of this software will always be available from the project
website:

http://www.barrywardell.net/Research/Code/CovariantSeries/

Install
---------
Extract the zip file and move the CovariantSeries and AbstractMatrix folders 
into your Mathematica applications folder. This is typically located in the 
following places:

Linux: 	/usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/
Mac:   	/Library/Mathematica/Applications/
Windows:Unknown

although any location listed by Mathematica's $Path variable should be fine.
The code can then be loaded into Mathematica using the command:

<< CovariantSeries`

For outputting in explicit Riemann tensor form, xTensor
(http://metric.iem.csic.es/Martin-Garcia/xAct/index.html) is required and the
AvramidiToXTensor package must also be loaded:

<< CovariantSeries`AvramidiToXTensor`

Examples
--------
For example usage, see the CovariantSeriesExamples.nb Mathematica notebook.

Changelog
---------
17 Aug  2009: Version 1.0 released.
              Full support for converting to xTensor notation.
              Correct calculation of SqrtDeltaInvBitensor.
              More efficient calculation of DeWitt coefficients.
              Support for calculating off-diagonal DeWitt coefficients.
              Add support for a potential term in the wave equation.
26 June 2009: Version 0.9.1 released.
              No code changes, but repackaged so that Mathematica will
              actually load the package properly.
 2 June 2009:	Initial version (0.9) released.
